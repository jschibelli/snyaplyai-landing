**📝 Change Request – SynaplyAI Landing Page**  

**Project:** SynaplyAI Landing Page – Final Adjustments  
**Deadline:** March 28, 2025  

---

### **1. Hero Section – CTA Spacing** *(High Priority)*  
✅ Increase the horizontal gap between the **"Join the Beta"** and **"Secure Early Access"** buttons by **+12px**.  
✅ Ensure the buttons remain side-by-side on desktop and stacked vertically on mobile.  

**Goal:** Improve visual balance and avoid button crowding.  

---

### **2. Hero Section – "Learn More" Button** *(Medium Priority)*  
✅ **Option 1:** Remove "Learn More" button entirely.  
✅ **Option 2:** If retained, link it to a placeholder "About" page.  

**Goal:** Avoid confusion since there’s no live destination for this button yet.  

---

### **3. Business Results Section – Tooltip/Hover State** *(High Priority)*  
✅ Add a **hover state** on business metrics to provide more detail:  
- Example for "25% Lower AI Content Costs":  
   ➡️ *"Based on internal testing across multi-model content generation scenarios."*  
- Example for "30% Faster Time-to-Market":  
   ➡️ *"AI-assisted content suggestions and real-time sync improved workflow efficiency by 30%."*  

**Goal:** Reinforce credibility by providing context for the business results.  

---

### **4. Conflict Resolution Metric Update** *(High Priority)*  
✅ Update "98% Conflict Resolution Accuracy" → **"98.7%"** (based on latest performance tests).  

**Goal:** Ensure accuracy and avoid under-reporting our key differentiator.  

---

### **5. Pricing Section – Urgency Subtext** *(Medium Priority)*  
✅ Under "Secure Early Access" button → Add subtext:  
*"Priority invites will be sent on a first-come, first-served basis."*  

**Goal:** Create subtle urgency without being aggressive.  

---

### **6. Core Features Section – Grouping + Mobile Padding** *(Medium Priority)*  
✅ Group similar features together for visual balance:  
- **Group 1:** AI Model Access + Conflict Resolution  
- **Group 2:** Collaboration + Event Sourcing  
- **Group 3:** Governance + Audit Tracking  

✅ Increase vertical padding by **+8px** on mobile for better tap targets and readability.  

**Goal:** Reduce cognitive load and improve mobile experience.  

---

### **7. Mobile and Accessibility Adjustments** *(Final Step)*  
✅ Confirm consistent button size and alignment across all screen sizes.  
✅ Confirm hover states and focus visibility.  
✅ Confirm `aria-label` attributes for screen readers.
